Hello! I am a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist at [PowerMart ApS](http://www.powermart.eu), a power trading firm based in Aarhus, Denmark. Prior to that, I was a researcher at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) and was awarded a PhD in Physics from the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). I nurture a broad range of interests that include applied mathematics, statistical and time series analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Artifical Intelligence is often touted as the [new electricity](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264). 
I like to think of myself as using the "new electricity" to add value to the business of the "old electricity". I go about achieving this goal by using the state of the art tools in time series forecasting and by building automated trading algorithms.
