Hello! I am a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist at [PowerMart ApS](http://www.powermart.eu), a power trading firm based in Aarhus, Denmark. Prior to that, I carried out research at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/) and was awarded a PhD in Physics from the [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/english/). I nurture a broad range of interests that include applied mathematics, statistical and time series analysis, machine and deep learning. Currently, I channel these interests to model and predict time series data and build automated algorithms.
