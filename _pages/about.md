Hello! I am a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist at PowerMart ApS, a power trading firm based in Aarhus, Denmark. Prior to that, I carried out research at the Niels Bohr Institute and was awarded a PhD in Physics from the University of Copenhagen. I nurture a broad range of interests that include applied mathematics, statistical and time series analysis, machine and deep learning. Currently, I channel these interests to model and predict time series data and build automated algorithms.
