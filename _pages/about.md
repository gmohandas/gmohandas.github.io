Hello and welcome to my quaint little corner of the world wide web! I am presently a Senior Quantitative Analyst at [Ã˜rsted](https://orsted.com) in Copenhagen, Denmark. I have a PhD in Physics from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark where I conducted research into different problems in theoretical astrophysics at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/). I nurture a broad range of interests that span topics in applied mathematics, theoretical physics, statistical and time series analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

During the last few years, I have spent a great deal of time using statistical/machine learning methods to perform time series analysis and forecasting. I have employed a number of tools that fall under the broad umbrella of AI in order to study energy market variables and solve different business problems.  
AI is in some circles touted as the [new electricity](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264). 
I, therefore, like to think of myself as using the "new electricity" to add value to the business of the "old electricity".
