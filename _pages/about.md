Hello! I am a Senior Quantitative Analyst at [Ã˜rsted](https://orsted.com) in Copenhagen, Denmark. I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark where I conducted research into different problems in theoretical astrophysics at the [Niels Bohr Institute](https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/). I nurture a broad range of interests that span topics in applied mathematics, theoretical physics, statistical and time series analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

I have spent a great deal of time using machine learning methods to perform time series analysis and forecasting during the last few years. 
I have applied a number of methods that fall under the broad umbrella of AI in order to predict variables relevant to the energy industry. 
AI is often touted as the [new electricity](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264). 
I like to think of myself as using the "new electricity" to add value to the business of the "old electricity".
