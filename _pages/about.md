Hello! I am a Quantitative Analyst slash Data Scientist at Ã˜rsted in Copenhagen, Denmark. I hold a PhD in Physics from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark where I conducted research into different problems in theoretical astrophysics. I nurture a broad range of interests that span topics in applied mathematics, theoretical physics, statistical and time series analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

AI is often touted as the [new electricity](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264). 
I like to think of myself as using the "new electricity" to add value to the business of the "old electricity". I go about achieving this goal by using the state of the art analytical tools to gain insights into the variables that drive the energy market as well as to chart its future course.
