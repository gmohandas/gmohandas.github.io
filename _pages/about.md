Hello! I am a Quantitative Analyst and Data Scientist at PowerMart ApS, a power trading firm based in Aarhus, Denmark. Prior to that, I was a researcher at the Niels Bohr Institute and was awarded a PhD in Physics from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. I nurture a broad range of interests that include topics in applied mathematics, statistical and time series analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

AI is often touted as the [new electricity](https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264). 
I like to think of myself as using the "new electricity" to add value to the business of the old electricity. I go about achieving this goal by using the state of the art analytical tools to gain insights into the variables that drive the energy market as well as chart its future course.
