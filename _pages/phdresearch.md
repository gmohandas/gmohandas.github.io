My PhD research dealt with a few select problems in the field of theoretical astrophysics. Breaking a bit with convention, I studied three problems that were mostly independent of each other, but were, nonetheless, within the wider domain of planetary astrophysics. Specifically, I investigated the
- the stability of charged particle motion in planetary magnetospheres
- the effect of magnetic diffusion on the stability of gaseous disks around young stars
- the atmospheric thermal structure of (exo)planets

which led to the following results, respectively,

- the (quirky and counterintuitive) possibility of instability due to dissipation
- the theoretical possibility of predominantly hydrodynamic turbulence in a magnetized gas disk
- the most general thermal planar atmospheric structure using the radiative transfer theory

For the details, please have a look at my [PhD thesis](https://gmohandas.github.io/files/gm-phdthesis.pdf)
and my publications.
