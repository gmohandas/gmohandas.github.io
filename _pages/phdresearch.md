My PhD research dealt with a few select problems in the field of theoretical astrophysics. Breaking a bit from convention, I studied three problems that were mostly independent of each other, but were, nonetheless, within the wider domain of planetary astrophysics. Specifically, I investigated the
- the stability of charged particle motion in planetary magnetospheres
- the effect of magnetic diffusion on the stability of gaseous disks around young stars
- the atmospheric thermal structure of planets
