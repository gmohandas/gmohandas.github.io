   This paper conducts an exhaustive study of the local stability of accretion disks, specifically protoplanetary disks 
   subject to various so-called non-ideal effects in weakly ionized and weakly magnetized plasmas. Our findings indicate 
   the degree to which the material disk properties and the magnetic field are efficiently transported through the disk.
