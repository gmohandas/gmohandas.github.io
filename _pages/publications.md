<li> *Orbital stability in static axisymmetric fields*
   [Journal](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10569-018-9881-1)
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07106)
   
   In this paper, we advance the stability theory of a charged particle in circular orbit. We discover new modes of
   stabilization and destabilization. Our results suggest potential implications for the stability of planetary ring
   systems.

<li> *Dust Segregation in Hall-dominated Turbulent Protoplanetary Disks*
   [Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aadcf0/pdf)
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07660)
   
   This paper, led by my colleagues, presents a thorough computational study of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic conditions
   present in a protoplanetary disk and the dust concentrations and density structures that it leads to.

2. *Analytical Models of Exoplanetary Atmospheres. V. Non-gray Thermal Structure with Coherent Scattering*
   [Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aab35d/pdf)
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.00629)
   
   In this paper, we derive a comprehensive analytical model of irradiated planetary atmospheres. 
   In the era of extra-solar planet discovery, this model would prove beneficial in understanding the atmospheric properties
   of these distant worlds.

1. *Spectral Analysis of Non-ideal MRI Modes: The Effect of Hall Diffusion*
   [Journal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aa6118/pdf)
   [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04979)

   This paper conducts an exhaustive study of the local stability of accretion disks, specifically protoplanetary disks 
   subject to various so-called non-ideal effects in weakly ionized and weakly magnetized plasmas. Our findings indicate 
   the degree to which the material disk properties and the magnetic field are efficiently transported through the disk.
